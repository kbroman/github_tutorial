All statistical/computational scientists should use
[git](http://git-scm.com) and [github](http://github.com), but it can be
hard to get started.  I hope these pages help.  (More blather below.)

There are many resources for git and github; my aim is to provide the
minimal guide to get started.

- [Why git and github?](pages/why.html)
- [Your first time](pages/first_time.html): get github account;
  install git, set up ssh.
- [Typical use](pages/routine.html): add, commit, push, status,
  and diff.
- [Start a new repository](pages/init.html): from scratch, or with an
  existing project.
- [Contribute to someone's repository](pages/fork.html): fork.
- [Handling merge conflicts](pages/merge_conflicts.html).
- [Oops; that last commit message was wrong](pages/amend_commit_msg.html).
- [Exploring the code and its history](pages/exploring_code.html):
  tag, diff
- [Branching and merging](pages/branching.html).
- [Git/github with RStudio](pages/rstudio.html)
- [Other (much more thorough) resources](pages/resources.html).

I hate git and github.  I use both for keeping track of programming
projects, papers, talks, and data analyses.  And github has enabled me
to contribute at least major things to others' projects, like the
[D phobos library](https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/phobos)
and [d3-tip](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip).

I use git mostly from the command line on a Mac.  I use the github
site to explore others' code, to indicate issues in their code, and
suggest changes to their code.

I would like all of my statistical/computational collaborators to use
git and github, so that we
may collaborate more easily.  But for
statisticians with no history of use of version control, it can be
hard to get started.  This is a tutorial of sorts, to help.

[Saunak Sen](http://www.epibiostat.ucsf.edu/biostat/sen/index.html)
got me started with version control (using subversion), and
[Pjotr Prins](http://www.thebird.nl) got me to move from subversion to
git, but don't hold either responsible for any errors in my
understanding.

If you have suggestions for changes or improvements,

fork [the repo](http://github.com/kbroman/github_tutorial): Follow the
instructions above, &ldquo;[Contribute to someone's repository](pages/fork.html).&rdquo;
